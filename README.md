# covid-uncounted
learning data stuff by trying to estimate uncounted covid cases

first, make a (chartjunky?) plot of "shadow" cases

make it interactive, selecting states first
maybe also allow swapping different data streams from covidtracking.com
e.g. negatives vs negativeViral + negativeAntigen 

then hook up interactive controls for a few different estimation functions

first with simple sqrt function from: https://covid19-projections.com/estimating-true-infections/

then add adjustment for testing per person

keep tweaking?
realize it's hopelessly crude relative to e.g. https://pandemicnavigator.oliverwyman.com/?
